## Teaching

[Autonomous Robots](https://muia.dia.fi.upm.es/en/) (European MSc in Artificial Intelligence). This course delves into the fundamental principles of mobile robot autonomous navigation. Students will explore state-of-the-art hybrid artificial intelligence methods for robot control. A practical mini-project requires students to develop maps of unknown environments for subsequent path planning.

[Robotics](https://www.fi.upm.es/?pagina=1645) (European MSc in Informatics Engineering). This project-based course focuses on applying hybrid artificial intelligence methods in robotics. Students begin by exploring key areas of robotics, encompassing both industrial and autonomous domains. Students subsequently conduct a state-of-the-art review and define a project, which they execute over the semester with regular weekly progress discussions. The final deliverables include a conference paper and a formal presentation of their work.

[Robotics](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=gcdia) (Bachelor Degree in Data Science and Artificial Inteligence). This introductory course explores robotics from the perspective of data science and artificial intelligence. Students will learn the fundamentals of industrial and autonomous robotics, detailing commonly used sensors and actuators. The course also reviews and compares various mobile robot control methods, and covers imaging and computer vision techniques with direct applications in robotics.
